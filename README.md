# Dice rolling game

In this game 2 players play together.
Player 1 has the first chance so player 1 will click on the dice roll button and whichever the number comes(except for 1) he/she will get another chance to roll the dice untless the number 1 comes on the dice or the player 1 clicks on the hold button.
If the player 1 got number 1 then all previous total of the numbers will be lost and the other player gets the chance.
And if the player 1 clicks on the hold button then the total of the numbers upto that point will add up to the score and other player will get the chance.
In this way whoever scores 20 first will win the game.
